# Cognitive Inbox - A Real-Time Conversational Email Assistant

Doing a complete overhaul of this project. Instead of developing a simple real-time email sorter, 
I am developing a conversational email assistant using langchain.

The goal is to have a web application where I can have a natural language conversation with my entire Gmail inbox. 
The chat agent will be able to retrieve information based on content, dates, and senders, 
and will process (update the vector database) with new emails in real-time for up-to-date information.
