# Project idea
Developing a machine learning project to sort incoming emails into appropriate folders in my gmail account.
I was tired of doing it manually and used to delay sorting new emails, and it ultimately accumulated to the backlog.

# Success metrics
Successfully sort incoming emails with >= 90% accuracy
Reduce effort of manual sorting

# Failure case
In the case where the probability of an email is <= 75 % for any folder, put it into the "Unsorted" folder.

# Sorted folders supported
- Phone
- Home internet
- Bank account
- credit account
- Job applications (Confirmation of jobs applied)
- OAs/Interview invitations
- Online deliveries
- Food deliveries
- Investments
- Car rental
- Apartment rental
- Hotel bookings
- flight bookings
- Insurance
- Unsorted (need manual sorting)
