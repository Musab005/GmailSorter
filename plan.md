5. Select best performing model based on evaluation metrics

### 3.3 Model Refinement
1. Analyze misclassified emails
2. Refine feature extraction based on error analysis
3. Implement feature selection techniques
4. Add domain-specific features (e.g., sender domain reputation, email time patterns)
5. Retrain and reassess model performance

## Phase 4: Gmail Integration (2-3 weeks)

### 4.1 Gmail Label Management
1. Develop functions to retrieve existing Gmail labels
2. Implement label creation for new categories
3. Build a mapping between model predictions and Gmail labels
4. Create a mechanism to apply/remove labels from emails
5. Test label management functionality

### 4.2 Historical Email Processing
1. Implement batch processing for existing emails
2. Create a throttling mechanism to respect Gmail API quotas
3. Build progress tracking and reporting features
4. Include error handling and retry logic
5. Test on a subset of emails before full implementation

### 4.3 New Email Monitoring
1. Implement a mechanism to detect new emails
2. Create a real-time or scheduled processing pipeline
3. Develop confidence thresholds for automatic vs. manual sorting
4. Design a feedback mechanism for correcting misclassifications
5. Test with various email types and scenarios

## Phase 5: Deployment & Automation (2-3 weeks)

### 5.1 Local Testing & Refinement
1. Conduct end-to-end system testing
2. Measure and optimize processing performance
3. Refine error handling and logging
4. Create user configuration interface if needed
5. Document system architecture and workflows

### 5.2 Google Cloud Deployment
1. Prepare service for Google Cloud deployment
2. Set up Cloud Functions or App Engine for continuous service
3. Implement proper security measures for credentials
4. Configure scheduled triggers for regular execution
5. Set up monitoring and alerting

### 5.3 Continuous Improvement System
1. Implement a feedback loop for model improvement
2. Create a mechanism to collect newly labeled data
3. Design a periodic model retraining process
4. Implement A/B testing for model improvements
5. Create performance dashboards for monitoring

## Phase 6: Evaluation & Refinement (1-2 weeks)

### 6.1 Performance Assessment
1. Measure classification accuracy on real-world usage
2. Calculate time saved through automation
3. Identify common misclassification patterns
4. Gather user feedback (if applicable)
5. Document findings and improvement opportunities

### 6.2 System Refinement
1. Refine model based on real-world performance
2. Optimize processing pipeline for speed and efficiency
3. Add additional features based on findings
4. Improve user experience (if applicable)
5. Create final documentation and maintenance plan
